### Using zsh frameworks

#### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Add `antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-completions` to your `~/.zshrc`.

#### [oh-my-zsh](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

* Clone the repository inside your oh-my-zsh repo:

        git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-~/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions

* Add it to `FPATH` in your `.zshrc` by adding the following line before `source "$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"`:

        fpath+=${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-~/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions/src

Note: adding it as a regular Oh My ZSH! plugin will not work properly (see [#603](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/issues/603)).

#### [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)

Add `zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions` to your `~/.zshrc`.

### Using Homebrew

### [Brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)
* Install command:
        
        brew install zsh-completions

* To activate these completions, add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

    ```sh
    if type brew &>/dev/null; then
     FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

     autoload -Uz compinit
     compinit
    fi
    ```

* You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

        rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

* Additionally, if you receive `"zsh compinit: insecure directories"` warnings when attempting to load these completions, you may need to run this:

        chmod -R go-w '$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh'
        
### Manual installation

* Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git

* Include the directory in your `$fpath`, for example by adding in `~/.zshrc`:

        fpath=(path/to/zsh-completions/src $fpath)

* You may have to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

        rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
