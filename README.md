**Additional completion definitions for [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).**

*This project aims at gathering/developing new completion scripts that are not available in Zsh yet. The scripts may be contributed to the Zsh project when stable enough.*

### Using zsh frameworks

#### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Add `antigen bundle zsh-users/zsh-completions` to your `~/.zshrc`.

#### [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

To avoid issues with redundant `.zcompdump` cache generation (see [#603](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/issues/603)), do **not** load `zsh-completions` as a standard plugin.  
Instead, follow this optimized approach:

1. Clone the repository into your custom plugins directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-~/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions
```

2. Update your `~/.zshrc` configuration **before** sourcing oh-my-zsh:

```bash
fpath+=${ZSH_CUSTOM:-${ZSH:-~/.oh-my-zsh}/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions/src
autoload -U compinit && compinit
source "$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"
```

This prevents `compinit` from being called twice and significantly improves shell startup time.

#### [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)

Add `zinit light zsh-users/zsh-completions` to your `~/.zshrc`.

---

### Manual installation

* Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git
```

* Include the directory in your `$fpath`, for example by adding in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
fpath=(path/to/zsh-completions/src $fpath)
```

* You may have to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

```bash
rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
```

---

Second Solution:
zsh-completions as a plugin, they suggest manually adding its source directory to fpath before sourcing oh-my-zsh.sh.
This ensures Zsh loads the completion files only once, improving performance.
Recommended Fix:
Instead of the existing method, they propose adding this line:

fpath=($ZSH/custom/plugins/zsh-completions/src $fpath)
